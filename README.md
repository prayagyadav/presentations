# Presentations


## Links to my 10 min master's presentations
- These were the presentations given to the High-Energy committee at the university as a part of project updates and evaluation.
- There was one update in the 9th semester (I had an Integrated Masters programme, so 9th semester is actually the 3rd semester of MSc)
- There were two updates in the 10th semester (MidTerm and Final)
